This github contains the code used in a bachelor thesis. All jupyter workshops where used with Google Colab, where the runtime type was set to A100 GPU.

The dataset used for the project was UC3M-LP, provided by √Ålvaro Ramajo Ballester (https://github.com/ramajoballester/UC3M-LP). The dataset was modified in order to be able to use with YOLOv8 and TrOCR. The version used for TrOCR can be found in this github. The version used for YOLOv8 can be find here: https://universe.roboflow.com/dvktest/lp-test-jfn0k. 
The RoboFlow version is just a ported version of Ramajo Ballesters dataset. This version was created before Ramajo Ballester added the ability to convert the dataset to YOLO on his github.
